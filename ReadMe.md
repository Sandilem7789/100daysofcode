# #100daysOfCode
**This repo is for tracking my progress as I partake in the 100daysofcode challenge**
## Projects in this Repo
1. **FullStackReactCourse** : This is an online course I am CURRENTLY taking course on Cousera.org(The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology) 
2. **./ch2_bootstrap/conFusion**: This is the root folder of the first part of the course where I was learning bootstrap, css flexbox, gulp, grunt, npm scripts amongst other things
3. **meadowlarkTravel** : I was following a book here, the book turned out to be too dated to work with peacefully, npm modules.
4. **mernLearn** : This is anouther dated book but a good step in the right direction: FullStack.
5. **ReactPractise** : Here I was folowing a tutorial by TraversyMedia, a crash course in react.
