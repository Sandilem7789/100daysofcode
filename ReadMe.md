# #100daysOfCode
**This repo is for tracking my progress as I partake in the 100daysofcode challenge**
## Projects in this Repo
1. **FullStackReactCourse** : This is an online I am CURRENTLY taking course on Cousera.org
    a. **./ch2_bootstrap/conFusion**: This is the root folder of the first part of the course where I was learning bootstrap, css flexbox, gulp, grunt, npm scripts amongst other things
2. **meadowlarkTravel** : I was following a book here, the book turned out to be too dated to work with peacefully, npm modules.
3. **mernLearn** : This is anouther dated book but a good step in the right direction: FullStack.
